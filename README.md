# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Using-ANN

# 🖋️ Handwritten Digit Classification ing ANNus

This project demonstrates how to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset** using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** built with **TensorFlow/Keras**. The model is trained to recognize digits (0–9) from 28x28 grayscale images.

## 📌 Features
- Built using a simple feedforward neural network (ANN)
- Trained on the MNIST dataset
- Uses `ReLU` and `Softmax` activations
- Evaluates performance with accuracy score
- Visualizes training and validation loss/accuracy

---
